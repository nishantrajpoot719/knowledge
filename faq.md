**Q: What makes Country Delight milk different?**
**A:** Country Delight sources fresh cow and buffalo milk directly from farmers, delivering it within 24-36 hours of milking. The milk is natural (no powder or preservatives) and tested for adulterants at multiple stages.

**Q: How can I get the Country Delight milk test kit?**

*   **General Steps:** Place a strip on a clean surface, add one drop of mixed milk to each test zone, wait (usually 5-10 minutes as per kit instructions), and compare the color change to the reference chart provided.
*   **Specific Tests (based on one version in source):**
    *   **MQ-2 (Quality):** Milk turns blue. If it stays blue after 25 mins, quality is good. If it becomes colorless, quality is poor.

    *   **STARCH:** No change if natural. Visible blue sediments appear if starch is present.
